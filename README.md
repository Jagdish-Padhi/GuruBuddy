## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 7 ‚Äì Weave AI magic with Groq**
---

## üéØ Objective

- Build a creative and interactive multimodal application powered by Groq, leveraging its capabilities
to solve real-world problems with a focus on user experience and innovation.

- In educational institutions, teachers often face a recurring problem: remembering exactly where they left off in previous lectures. This challenge becomes even more complex when they teach the same subject across multiple divisions. The result is confusion, disrupted class flow, and additional stress. Teachers also frequently encounter difficulties in quickly solving student doubts or providing relatable real-world examples during lectures.

**GuruBuddy** is a smart, modern assistant built to solve these challenges. It lightens the daily burden of teachers by:

- Providing timely, automated lecture reminders.
- Tracking and updating last-taught topics automatically.
- Offering instant AI-powered help for expert doubt solving and real-world explanations.

- üöÄ How GuruBuddy Works ?

- **Authentication**:  
  Teachers create an account and securely log in to the platform.

- **Schedule Setup**:  
  Teachers input their institution-assigned lecture schedules once.

- **Automated Lecture Reminder**:  
  Before each class, a popup appears showing:
  - The current subject.
  - The last topic taught.
  
  A voice prompt (available in both Hindi and English) also reinforces the reminder.  
  The popup remains active until acknowledged, ensuring no lecture is missed.

- **Post-Lecture Topic Update**:  
  After each lecture (with a 5-minute grace period), if the teacher hasn't manually updated the "last taught topic," a form automatically appears requesting the input. This ensures continuity for the next class.

- **Dynamic Topic Tracker**:  
  A live table updates and displays the last topics taught across all divisions and subjects, allowing easy tracking and edits.

- **Schedule Flexibility**:  
  Teachers can easily reset or customize their schedules if their institutional timetable changes.

- **AI Chat Assistant**:  
  A general-purpose chatbot powered by Groq AI helps teachers with quick queries, idea generation, and routine support.

- **Expert Doubt Solver**:  
  An groq AI-based expert tool helps teachers quickly resolve doubts and find relevant real-world examples, enriching the teaching experience.

### Your Approach:  
- **Why we chose this problem**: As a student, I noticed that teachers frequently faced difficulties in tracking the topics taught in multiple divisions. This inspired me to build a solution that could make the teaching process more efficient.
- **Key challenges**: The most significant challenge was ensuring the assistant could dynamically update topics across different classes, offer bilingual reminders, and maintain a simple user interface that teachers could use without technical skills.
- **Brainstorms & breakthroughs**: The use of a pop-up reminder system and bilingual notifications was a breakthrough idea, as it ensured the teachers wouldn't forget their last topic and could continue seamlessly.
